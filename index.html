      <p>Hi my name is Yusuf Qedan I was born and raised here in Portland. I am an aspiring full stack developer who is currently seeking employment. I have a very solid foundation when it comes to programming fundamentals and have real world experience in the high-tech industry. I became interested in computer software and hardware when I got involved in my high school robotics team where we had to design, build and program a robot in six weeks. I decided to major in computer engineering and earned a bachelor's degree from Portland State and later worked in semiconductor manufacturing. On the job I was reminded of my interest in software and decided to pursue opportunities where I could leverage my existing skills from college. I decided to attend Epicodus and have recently completed my coursework and I am starting my internship soon.</p>
